Yewdocs Server Configuration
============================

No configuration is necessary to work locally without mirroring changes
to the cloud (to a server through an internet connection):

https://doc.yew.io

If you want to have changes saved remotely, you need to provide certain
information, like:

-  Email: your email that has not been registered to Remote
-  URL: the endpoint for the remote Yewdocs service. Currently, that is
   just https://doc.yew.io
-  username: this is the username you desire to have on the remote
   service
-  first name: first name (optional)
-  last name: your last name (optional)

There are three commands:

-  yd configure: get information used to configure remote communication
-  yd register: get a new user account with the remote service
-  yd authenticate: authenticate with remote when you already have an
   account

In the case that a registration succeeds, you will have set a token that
forthwith enables transparent access to the remote server. The token is
secret and should be protected. Itâ€™s located in your home directory in
an sqlite database table.

You can check all user preferences via the ``user-pref`` command:

::

   $ yd user-pref
   location.default.url = https://doc.yew.io
   location.default.email = paul.wolf@yewleaf.com
   location.default.username = yewser
   location.default.password = None
   location.default.first_name = Paul
   location.default.last_name = Wolf
   location.default.token = fe0be94826b451bba72j54tjnwlr2jrn2o5cd9b
